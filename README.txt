The goal of this work is to provide a numerical algorithm for estimating the average trade duration, average inter-trade interval, and average number of trades, and then using that information to establish best pre-set boundaries that maximizes the minimal overall profit. The benchmark article is published by Heni Puspaningrum, YanXia Lin, Chandra M. Gulati at 2010, and its title is :"Finding the Optimal Pre-Set Boundaries for Pairs Trading Strategy Based on Cointegration Technique".
